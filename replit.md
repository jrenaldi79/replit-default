# Overview

This project is a Next.js 16 application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, utilizing the App Router architecture and Turbopack bundler. Its primary purpose is to provide a platform for a welcome page and an interactive markdown previewer with live rendering and XSS protection. The project adheres to a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology and incorporates the BMad Method framework for AI-driven agile development.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

The application is built on Next.js 16 with the stable Turbopack bundler, leveraging the App Router for modern React Server Components. TypeScript ensures type safety, and Tailwind CSS v3.4.x is used for utility-first styling. Jest with React Testing Library facilitates a TDD approach. Markdown parsing is handled by the `marked` library, with `isomorphic-dompurify` providing XSS sanitization. The server-side logic uses Node.js with Next.js Route Handlers.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Home Page**: A Server Component with a Tailwind CSS gradient background and responsive design, providing navigation links.
- **Markdown Preview**: A Client Component featuring an interactive sidebar for markdown file selection and a sanitized markdown renderer.
- **Responsive Design**: Achieved through Tailwind CSS utility classes.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **File System API**: A Route Handler (`/api/files`) recursively scans for markdown files, excluding sensitive directories, and returns relative paths.
- **Markdown Rendering API**: A Route Handler (`/api/markdown`) fetches and renders markdown content, applying server-side sanitization and validating file paths to prevent directory traversal.
- **Security**: Includes path validation, DOMPurify for XSS protection, and restrictive API access (e.g., GET only, non-descriptive error messages).

**System Design Choices:**
- **Next.js 16 App Router with Turbopack**: Chosen for superior performance (5-10x faster), modern React architecture, and stable Turbopack bundler.
- **TypeScript**: For enhanced developer experience and code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development.
- **TDD**: A core methodology ensuring robust and well-tested features.
- **Port 5000**: Configured for Replit webview integration.
